      <h2>What is Theraputty?</h2>
      <p>
        Theraputty is a firm, resistive putty (similar to slime or playdoh), used by occupational therapists to improve fine motor strength, motor coordination skills, and sensory processing. Kids absolutely LOVE it!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Quick tips for parents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with clean, dry hands to help keep your putty clean. Dirt, crumbs, lotion, or lint can make it sticky or crumbly over time. Wash hands after use.</li>
        <li>Choose a “Putty Spot” (i.e., a clean table or hard surface). Avoid couches, beds, rugs, and fabric-covered chairs—putty can stick and be hard to remove from soft surfaces.</li>
        <li>Supervise children under 3–4 years. Theraputty is non‑toxic but not edible.</li>
        <li>Store in the small container you received, and make sure the lid is on when not in use to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro‑tip</strong>: Keep in your purse, car, or use as part of a “sensory toolkit” for on‑the‑go. This is a simple and easy activity to keep kids busy during wait times or to help ease transitions!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Easy games that build skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hide‑and‑seek treasures</strong>: Press small beads or buttons into the slime. Let your child pinch and pull to find them—great for finger strength and pincer grasp.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Snakes & snips</strong>: Roll long “snakes,” then snip them with child‑safe scissors. This works hand muscles and cutting skills.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tug of War</strong>: Pull and stretch out with both hands. Great for strengthening upper body and hands.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stamp & match</strong>: Push coins, LEGO bricks, or letter tiles into putty. Then match the objects to their prints. Also helps eyes and hands work together.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Putty Meatballs and Pancakes</strong>: Break off smaller pieces and roll into “meatballs.” Flatten out with palms and fingertips to make “pancakes.” Great for older kids as a pre‑writing warm up, as this helps to “wake the hands up” by opening up the arches in their hands.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Log Press</strong>: Roll out a long log and press one finger at a time into putty. Works on finger isolation skills!
        </li>
        <li><strong>Practice and play with eating utensils</strong>: Use kid‑safe eating utensils to “feed” a stuffed animal or doll to work on independence with self‑feeding (i.e., learning how to pierce with a fork, cut with a knife).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Sensory Play</h2>
      <p>
        Putty isn’t just for building strong hands—it also gives calming, organizing input to the sensory system. The resistive, squishy texture offers <strong>deep pressure and tactile feedback</strong>, which can help kids:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feel grounded and focused</strong>: Great before school, transitions, or seated tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulate activity levels or big emotions</strong>: Squeezing and stretching something resistive, such as putty, provides a calming effect in both children and adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore touch in a safe, low‑mess way</strong>: Putty is a great tool for kids who need to keep their hands busy, as it provides tactile input without a big mess. It is also great for kids who are sensitive to certain textures, as it can help with sensory exploration in a fun and creative way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether your child needs help calming down, waking up, or just staying regulated during the day, a few minutes of putty play can gently support their sensory system without feeling like “work.”
